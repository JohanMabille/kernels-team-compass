Inactive council members are (temporarily or not) pausing their active
participation in the Jupyter Kernels community. They can reactivate

## Software Steering Council (SSC) Representative

Each *official* subproject in Jupyter gets a single [Software Steering Council representative](https://jupyter.org/governance/software_steering_council.html#software-steering-council). Jupyter Kernel's representative is elected by the active team members. In the Jupyter Kernel subproject, our representative is elected to a one-year term.

Jupyter Kernel's SSC representative is Johan Mabille.
